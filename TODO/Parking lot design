Ways to approach a general Design problem.

Use Cases Generation: Gather all the possible use cases

Constraints and Analysis: How many users, how much data etc.

Basic Design: Most basic design. Few users case.

Bottlenecks: Find the bottlenecks and solve them.

Scalability: A large number of users. 4 and 5 step will go in loop till we get a satisfactory answer

Current Scenario

Use cases for this problem.
Parking can be single-level or multilevel.
Types of vehicles that can be parked, separate spaces for each type of vehicle.
Entry and exit points.
Constraints
Number of vehicles that can be accommodated of any type.
Basic Design/High-Level Components
Vehicle/Type of vehicle.
Entry and Exit points.
Different spots for vehicles.
Bottlenecks
Capacity breach for any type of vehicle.
Scalability
Scalable from single-level to multi-level
Scalable from Bike only parking to accommodate all kinds of vehicles.
Keeping these in minds, APIs can be designed in the language of your preference.
